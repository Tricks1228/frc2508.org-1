        <p>
          Robots play Breakaway on a large rectangular field. Robots direct soccer balls into goals, traverse "bumps" in the field,  suspend themselves and each other on towers, and/or go through a tunnel located in the center of the field.The field is bordered by a  set of guardrails and alliance walls. During the game matches, the robots are  controlled from alliance stations located outside the ends of the field. These rectangular zones consist of three team player stations that provide connectivity between the controls used by the robot operators and the arena. Goals are located at the corners of the field, and extend behind the alliance and adjacent to the player stations. After goals are scored, human  players must pick up the balls and pass them to the center of the alliance station to be placed on a ball  return rack, after which they will re-enter play at midfield. Teams are penalized if balls are not re-entered  within a set time limit.

        <p>
          The goal of LUNACY is to score as many of the game pieces in the opposing side's trailers as possible. Robots start  out in front of the opposite alliances' human players. There is a 15-second autonomous period, during which robots  operate according to programs that teams download to their robot, and a 2-minute Teleoperated period, where robots  are driven and controlled by a human drive subteam at one end of the field. Empty cells (also worth 2 points) must be  handed to a robot by the "payload specialist" at the mid-field position known as the "outpost". The robot must deliver  the Empty Cell to their human player on one of the corners in order to get a Super Cell that is worth 15 points. A robot  can only carry one Empty Cell at a time. Super Cells can only be put into play during the last 20 seconds of play, and  only if the human player has been delivered an Empty Cell.

          FIRST Overdrive is played on a large,  carpeted field, divided lengthwise by a fence into Red and Blue zones.  The game includes giant balls called "Trackballs". Two three-team alliances race around the track while  manipulating the trackballs to score points.
